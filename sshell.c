/*
 * Now 'wbuf' is parsed into the string array 'buf_args'
 *
 * The for-loop uses a string.h function
 *   char *strsep(char **stringp, const char *delim);
 *
 *   Description:  
 *   If *stringp = NULL then it returns NULL and does
 *   nothing else.  Otherwise the function finds the first token in
 *   the string *stringp, where tokens are delimited by symbols
 *   in the string 'delim'.  
 *
 *   In the example below, **stringp is &wbu, and 
 *   the delim = ' ', '\n', and '\t'.  So there are three possible 
 *   delimiters. 
 *
 *   So in the string " Aloha World\n", the spaces and "\n" are
 *   delimiters.  Thus, there are three delimiters.  The tokens
 *   are what's between the delimiters.  So the first token is
 *   "", which is nothing because a space is the first delimiter.
 *   The second token is "Aloha", and the third token is "World".
 *   
 *   The function will scan a character string starting from
 *   *stringp, search for the first delimiter.  It replaces
 *   the delimiter with '\0', and *stringp is updated to point
 *   past the token.  In case no delimiter was found, the
 *   token is taken to be the entire string *stringp, and *stringp
 *   is made NULL.   Strsep returns a pointer to the token. 
 *
 *   Example:  Suppose *stringp -> " Aloha World\n"
 *
 *   The first time strsep is called, the string is "\0Aloha World\n",
 *   and the pointer value returned = 0.  Note the token is nothing.
 *
 *   The second time it is called, the string is "\0Aloha\0World\n",
 *   and the pointer value returned = 1  Note that 'Aloha' is a token.
 *
 *   The third time it is called, the string is '\0Aloha\0World\0', 
 *   and the pointer value returned is 7.  Note that 'World' is a token.
 *
 *   The fourth time it is called, it returns NULL.
 *
 *   The for-loop, goes through buffer starting at the beginning.
 *   wbuf is updated to point to the next token, and cp is
 *   updated to point to the current token, which terminated by '\0'.
 *   Note that pointers to tokens are stored in array buf_args through cp.
 *   The loop stops if there are no more tokens or exceeded the
 *   array buf_args.
